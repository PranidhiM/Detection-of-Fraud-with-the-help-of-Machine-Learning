# Detection-of-Fraud-with-the-help-of-Machine-Learning

This project mainly outlines a systematic approach to identifying fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. It details data collection from a synthetic financial transactions dataset, followed by preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to uncover patterns and correlations, aiding in feature engineering. The study applies multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Random Forest and XGBoost emerged as top performers due to their ability to handle imbalanced datasets and detect complex fraud patterns. Future improvements involve deep learning techniques like LSTMs and CNNs for enhanced detection accuracy and real-time fraud detection systems integrated with financial APIs. The project demonstrates the viability of machine learning in fraud prevention and suggests future advancements for more secure financial transactions.
